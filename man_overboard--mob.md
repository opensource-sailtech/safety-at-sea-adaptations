# Visual impairment (VI)

## Visual impairment and man overboard practice drills (VI MOB)

### Scenario  
For this set of instructions, please assume the following:  
- boat and crew setup is very typical of VI sailing (especially competitions)  
- difficulty level: easiest; stress level of drill is lowest that is realistic  
- sighted guide  
 - calls out while falling in water from aft quarter  
 - is wearing PFD  
 - is not wearing personal locator  
 - remains conscious and calm  
 - is competent helm in MOB situations  
- helm  
 - is experienced with MOB drills  
 - has visual impairment that prevents any sight of person in water, or of wind, waves and traffic  
- crew aboard  
 - one on mainsheet seated near experienced VI helm  
 - one on jib seated within easy earshot of helm  
- wind and sea states are light ([beaufort force 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale))  
- air and water temperatures are each 80Â°F  
- visibility is optimal  
- current is negligible  
- sea room is sufficiently ample not to be a factor  
- traffic in the area  
 - is light  
 - nearest helms see MOB  
 - all traffic stands clear  
- boat  
 - favors rescue at transom (typical family/charter cruiser-racer sailing vessle with high freeboard and low swim platform)  
 - has throwable floatation  
 - has GPS with MOB button  
 - has lazyjacks or similar  
 - has roller-furling jib or similar  

#### Steps in case 1: sailing upwind with full main and jib at 6kts  
1. MOB: yell asap and continue yelling  
2. helm: throw floatation in direction of yell  
3. helm: hit MOB button on GPS  
3. main:
  1. blow mainsheet and flog main sail  
  2. verbally check in that helm has successfully completed steps above  
4. jib:
  1. point at person in water continuously throughout maneuver  
  2. through upcoming tack and gybe, leave jib trim as is  
    - the tack will invert the jib (as when heaving to) and the jib will push the bow down for a tighter turn  
    - the gybe will reintroduce flow  
  3. as possible without interrupting your close focus on MOB and your continuous pointing, prepare jibsheet for quick and complete release (e.g. minimize wraps on winch; confirm tail will run free)  
5. helm: head up hard through a tack; hold turn to continue in a circle  
6. main:  
  1. prepare a gybe  
  2. when gybe is about to happen, loudly announce "ready to gybe" then "here comes the boom" or similar play-by-play so others anticipate what is happening in the gybe and keep themselves safe  
7. jib:  
  1. continuously share information about distance and course to MOB (e.g. MOB is at 9 o'clock and 3 boatlengths away)  
  2. while approaching MOB, give VI helm guidance on steering to port or starboard to  avoid hitting MOB while staying close
