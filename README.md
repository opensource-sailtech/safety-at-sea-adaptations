# Safety at Sea adaptations for sailors of varying abilities

Training curriculum.  
Work in progress.  
Intended focus: how varying physical abilities, boat types, safety equipment and wind/sea states affect various safety considerations.

## Visual impairment (VI)

### Visual impairment and man overboard practice drills (VI MOB)

#### Scenario  
- boat and crew setup is very typical of VI sailing (especially competitions)  
- difficulty level: easiest; stress level of drill is lowest that is realistic  
- sighted guide  
 - calls out while falling in water from aft quarter  
 - is wearing PFD  
 - is not wearing personal locator  
 - remains conscious and calm  
 - is competent helm in MOB situations  
- helm  
 - is experienced with MOB drills  
 - has visual impairment that prevents any sight of person in water, or of wind, waves and traffic  
- crew aboard  
 - one on mainsheet seated near experienced VI helm  
 - one on jib seated within easy earshot of helm  
- wind and sea states are light ([beaufort force 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale))  
- air and water temperatures are each 80Â°F  
- visibility is optimal  
- current is negligible  
- sea room is sufficiently ample not to be a factor  
- traffic in the area  
 - is light  
 - nearest helms see MOB  
 - all traffic stands clear  
- boat  
 - favors rescue at transom (typical family/charter cruiser-racer sailing vessle with high freeboard and low swim platform)  
 - has throwable floatation  
 - has GPS with MOB button  
 - has lazyjacks or similar  
 - has roller-furling jib or similar  

##### Steps in case 1: sailing upwind with full main and jib at 6kts  
1. MOB: yell asap and continue yelling  
2. helm: throw floatation in direction of yell  
3. helm: hit MOB button on GPS  
3. main: blow mainsheet and flog mailsail; verbally check in that helm has successfully completed steps above  
4. jib: point at person in water continuously throughout maneuver; initially leave jib trim as is, but as allowed by close   focus on MOB prepare jibsheet for quick and complete release (e.g. minimize wraps on winch; confirm tail will run free)  
5. helm: head up hard through a tack; hold turn to continue in a circle  
6. main: prepare a gybe
7. main: when gybe is about to happen, loudly announce "ready to gybe" then "here comes the boom" or similar play-by-play so others anticipate what is happening in the gype and keep themselves safe  
7. jib: continuously share information about distance and course to MOB (e.g. MOB is at 9 o'clock and 3 boatlengths away)
8. jib: while approaching MOB, give helm guidance on steering to port or starboard to avoid hitting MOB
