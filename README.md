# Safety at Sea adaptations for sailors of varying abilities

Training curriculum. Work in progress. 
Intended initial focus on how varying physical abilities, boat types, safety equipment and wind/sea states affect various safety considerations.

## Visual impairment (VI)

### Visual impairment and man overboard practice drills (VI MOB)

#### Scenario  
- boat and crew setup is very typical of VI sailing (especially competitions)  
- difficulty level: easiest  
- sighted guide  
 -- calls out while falling in water from aft quarter  
 -- is wearing PFD  
 -- is not wearing personal locator
 -- remains conscious and calm  
 -- is competent helm in MOB situations  
- helm  
 -- is experienced with MOB drills  
 -- has visual impairment that prevents any sight of person in water, or of wind, waves and traffic
- crew aboard  
 -- one on mainsheet seated near experienced VI helm  
 -- one on jib seated within easy earshot of helm  
- wind and sea states are light ([beaufort force 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale))  
- air and water temperatures are each 80Â°F
- visibility is optimal
- traffic in the area  
 -- is light  
 -- nearest helms see MOB  
 -- all traffic stands clear  
- boat  
 -- favors rescue at transom (typical family/charter cruiser-racer sailing vessle with high freeboard and low swim platform)  
 -- has throwable floatation
 -- has GPS with MOB button
 -- has lazyjacks or similar
 -- has roller-furling jib or similar
- stress level of drill is lowest that is realistic

##### Case 1
- sailing upwind with full main and jib at 6kts
